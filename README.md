A pride flag emporium!

It requires Apache to host properly because it depends on .htaccess for routing.

My first time using PHP. I liked it for how much its made fun of lol

Pride flags can be added simply by adding a toml file in `flags/` with
a description, name, emoji if possible, and some tags. the image link should
be to an image put in `img/`.

There's no caching right now, and detailed pages don't work. But it's getting there.
